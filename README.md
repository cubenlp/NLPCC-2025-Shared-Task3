# NLPCC Shared Task 3-**Comprehensive Argument Analysis for Chinese Argumentative Essay**

This shared task includes two tracks:

- Track 1: Argument Component Detection (ACD): This track aims to build the fundamental argumentative structure by identifying the argumentative components. Given an essay as input, the output is expected to be the argumentative component categories of each sentence block, which indicates the role it serves within the text.
- Track 2: Argument Relation Identification (ARI): The objective of this task is to extract and classify the possible argumentative relations between various argumentative components, thereby forming an comprehensive understanding of the author's argumentative logic.  

For more information, please read the `Task Guideline.pdf`.
