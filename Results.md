It is strongly recommended that you submit your results at least once before April 20, 2025, to ensure that your submission is properly received and considered for evaluation.
2. Please visit https://nlpcc2025task3.cubenlp.com/ to submit your results. Your submission should be a JSON file formatted according to the specifications in  `Task Guideline.pdf ` .
